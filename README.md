# Search Engine

Search Engine is a simple search application built in Java. It allows you to search for specific keywords within a collection of documents using an inverted index and a multithreaded web crawler.

## Features

- Inverted index implementation for efficient keyword-based searching.
- Multithreaded web crawler to fetch and index web pages.
- Configurable search options, including specifying the number of search results to display.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Installation

To run the Search Engine locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ahmaadidrees/searchEngine.git

3. Navigate to the project directory: cd searchEngine

4. Compile the Java source files: javac *.java

5. Run the application: java SearchEngine

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform searches and explore the indexed documents.

## Usage

Once you have the Search Engine running, you can perform the following actions:

- Enter keywords to search for within the indexed documents.
- Specify the number of search results to display.
- View the search results along with relevant information.
- Navigate through the indexed documents using their respective URLs.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the Search Engine implementation to suit your needs. Here are a few suggestions:

- Extend the functionality by adding advanced search features like phrase searching or Boolean operators.
